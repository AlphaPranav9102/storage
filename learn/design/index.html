            The Design subteam, unsurprisingly, designs. They brainstorm ideas and plans for things we build, and then proceed to work out the details for the actual design, all along with mechanical.
            They also CAD our robot, so Mechanical can put it together.
            If you have any questions about the subteam or anything we do, please contact us at contact@team4099.com. We'd be
            happy to answer any questions.
