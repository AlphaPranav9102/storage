            The Programming subteam programs the robot for competition (not an easy task) and all sorts of other cool things. 
            They do a lot of hard work changing a few numbers and uploading repeatedly to get the robot up and running.
            If you have any questions about the subteam or anything we do, please contact us at contact@team4099.com. We'd be
