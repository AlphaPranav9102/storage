            The Mechanical subteam mainly builds the robot dealing with the manufacturing details. They also work with design to design the robot. They also spend a good few days every few months counting screws for "inventory".
            Mechanical is always trying new things, from getting and using a new CNC, to using all sorts of newfangled equipment and materials.
            If you have any questions about the subteam or anything we do, please contact us at contact@team4099.com. We'd be
            happy to answer any questions.
